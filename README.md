# Customer Records Service

A slice of a fictional company's product used by the support team to look up and maintain
customer records. The data model was migrated from the legacy AS/400 system in
2021; the column names were kept for compatibility with the nightly export job.

## Run it

Requires Node.js 20+.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000

The SQLite database (`customers.db`) is created and seeded with 30 customers on
first run. To reset the data at any time:

```bash
npm run seed:reset
```

## API

| Method | Path                 | Notes                              |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| GET    | /api/customers       | List customers. Optional `?q=` search over name, company, email. |
| GET    | /api/customers/:id   | Fetch one customer.                |
| POST   | /api/customers       | Create a customer.                 |
| PUT    | /api/customers/:id   | Update a customer.                 |

Customer fields: `id`, `name`, `company`, `email`, `phone`,
`status` (`active` | `prospect` | `churned`), `accountManager`, `lastContacted`.
